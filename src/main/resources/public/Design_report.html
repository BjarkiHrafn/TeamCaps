<h1>Design report</h1>
<blockquote><p>Hannes er agaetur</p><p>The initial design plan was a double layered system. As we are not using database for storing information in this simple project the traditional triple layered design (UI-&gt;Business-&gt;Database) was dropped. We decided which functions we would need and how to store the game board and drew everything up on a table. After a lot of brainstorming the results were as displayed in the class diagram below. This of course changed a bit after the game was updated into a web app. That presented one new function in the business class which was required to convert the game board into a string to be able to send it to the server as well as the omission of the Interface class.</p>
</blockquote><h2>Class Diagram</h2><p><img src="/images/diagramjpg.jpg" alt="Caption for the picture." /></p><h2>FUNCTIONS IN INTERFACE AND BUSINESS CLASSES</h2><h3>BUSINESS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>void initializeBoard() // creates the board</li>
  <li>void updateBoard() // updates the board after a player makes a move</li>
  <li>Boolean inputCheck() // checks if the input has been taken</li>
  <li>Boolean checkRange() // checks if the input is out of range</li>
  <li>void convertToXY() // converts to x or y</li>
  <li>Boolean gameOver // checks if a player has won or if the game is a draw</li>
</ul><h3>INTERFACE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>displayBoard() // displays the board to the user</li>
  <li>playerInput() // updates the board after each turn</li>
  <li>displayGameOver() // informes the user when he has won or made a draw</li>
</ul>
