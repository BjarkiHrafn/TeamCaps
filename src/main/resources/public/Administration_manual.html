<h1>Administration manual</h1><h3>What is needed to build</h3>
<blockquote><h2>Install</h2>

    <li>In git, run gitbash in a fresh directory and run the command "git clone git@github.com:HUGB2017TeamCapslock/TeamCaps.git", this will clone the current master branch of the repository on your pc.</li>
    <li>To build run the command "gradle build" this will build the project on your own staging, make sure to make a new feature branch before making any changes to the current build.</li>
    <li>To run locally, run the command "gradle run" and open your web browser. Open the url http://localhost:4567 and you should see the program running.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote><h3>How to deploy, run and maintain</h3>
<blockquote><h2>How to deploy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>By merging a feature branch with origin/master, Travis automatically deploys the new master with the new content. Git command: "git push -u origin <feature branch name>"</p><h2>How to run</h2></li>
    <li><p>Use git command "gradle run" to run locally, otherwise the current deployment is at <a href="https://dry-bastion-22033.herokuapp.com/">Site</a></p><h2>How to maintain</h2></li>
    <li>Make a pull request to github by pushing a finished feature on a branch to origin/master with git command "git push -u origin <branchName>".</li>
    <li>From github repository make a pull request on branches with features that need to be deployed, this is linked to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a>. If travis build goes through green go to next step. If it goes red start over with a new pull request with corrected source code.</li>
    <li>From github repository access the pull request that should now be accepted by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and merge pull request.</li>
    <li>Travis automatically deploys the Travis-accepted new version to Heroku server.</li>
  </ul>
